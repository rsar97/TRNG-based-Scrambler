# TRNG-based-Scrambler
In the modern era where huge amounts of information are being produced every second, still many loopholes are being found in the secured way of transferring data which risks the privacy of IP. Moreover, access to sensitive/confidential IoT sensor Data is vulnerable while transferring. A way to mitigate the issue that may cause serious data breach opportunities in the transferring of information from the IoT Device to a Remote Desktop/user device is being handled in this work. A new system has been described that uses multiple True Random Number Generators(TRNGâ€™s) designed with the help of Fault-tolerant gates to generate OTP as a single-step authentication, which will then be used to transfer the files. Thus TRNG finds an effective application in the avenue of information security. The original IoT Sensor Data/scrambled IoT Sensor Data will be transferred depending upon the authentication. This ensures that only authorized users are accessible to the original data of the sensor values. The hamming distance of the original information file and the scrambled information file has been determined to verify the same and found to around 50%. Likewise, the time taken during original and scrambled file transfer has also been calculated to analyze the effectiveness of the proposal.
